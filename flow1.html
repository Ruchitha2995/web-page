                <p>Baikal uses a twofold approach. First, we identify academic student talent <span></span> through special testing. Then, we develop talent through time-tested courses <span></span> that are tailored, challenging, enriching, and transformational. It all began <span></span> with the pioneering work of Johns Hopkins’ psychologist Julian Stanley with <span></span> gifted middle school prodigies. His work put the spotlight on exceptionally <span></span> bright young people and their capacity and enthusiasm for academic <span></span> challenges matched to their advanced abilities.</p>
                <p>During its 2014 intensive 3-week residential program, 72% of the students <span></span> attended on scholarship, thanks to the generous support of the Stavros Niarchos <span></span> Foundation. 90 bright minds scouted from across Greece stayed at the Anatolia <span></span> College dormitory, spending their days testing and applying their knowledge and <span></span> expanding their horizons.</p>
